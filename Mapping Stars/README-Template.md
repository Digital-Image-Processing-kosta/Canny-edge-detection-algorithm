You are given 2 grayscale images, image before distortion and same image after distortion.
Find the (x, y) coordinates of the centroid (center of mass) of every shape in the 2 images you are given. 
Classify each shape into 6 categories (cross, spiral, circle, flower, star, donut). 
Given the (x, y) positions of the stars in the undistorted image, find their (x, y) positions in the distorted image.
Distortions can be: translation, rotation, scaling or their combination.
