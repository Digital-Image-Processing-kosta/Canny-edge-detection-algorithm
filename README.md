# Digital-Image-Processing
### Here you can find my projects in digital image processing: 
**1.** Detection and extraction of 6 different objects in an image. Comparing those objects on 2 images and finding rotation, translation and scaling of matched objects. Using these 2D transformations to restore coordinates on distorted image. (Python)
**2.** Extracting time from the given image of clock (Matlab)
**3.** Extracting score of red and blue dices from image (Matlab)
**4.** Filtering and repairing quality of different images (Matlab)
