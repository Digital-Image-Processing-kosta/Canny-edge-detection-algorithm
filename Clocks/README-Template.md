#### Extracts the time from a given image of a clock.
Function **'extract_time'** extracts the minutes and hours, 
and **'extract_time_bonus'** extracts seconds if the needle exists
(if not, outputs -1)

**TESTING**: Run the 'main.m' to test the functions on 12 images.

**NOTE**: The hyperparameters in Hough's transformation are tuned for Matlab 2017.
