Here you can find different ways of filtering and repairing quaility of images: sharpening, contrast repairing, noise removal, selective filtering, median filtering, Wiener's filtering...
In **images** folders you can find different original images before processing. If you find some of these images interesting you can check
**main.m** to see how i have repaired the quality.
Also you can check out functions that i have wrote from scratch:
1. **dos_clhe** - performs histogram equalization with contrast limiting
2. **dos_non_local_means** - performs non local averaging of the image
